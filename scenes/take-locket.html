            The $500 payout is too much to ignore. The ranger's warnings were probably just paranoia. You wrap the silver locket in your handkerchief and secure it deep in your inner pocket.

            *CLICK*
        </p>
        <p>
            The noise wasn't the radio. It was the sound of the locket's clasp closing.

            The room immediately goes dark. The fluorescent light above flickers, then bursts, showering the desk with glass.
        </p>
        <p>
            The radio on the desk shrieks a noise you've never heard: **pure, unmixed static.** It is a wall of sound that vibrates your teeth.

            The red marker lines on the map flash once, then instantly dissolve into dust. The containment circuit is broken.

            Outside the window, the fog is no longer mist. It is thick, corrosive black smoke, moving like a panicked tsunami. The trees are whipping violently.
        </p>
        <p>
            You catch a glimpse of something *in* the fog—something tall, with too many joints, before your brain refuses to process the sight. You taste copper.

        <p>
           You try to adjust the radio, twisting the dial almost snapping it off. But noting just a loud static

            <p>
                Everything starts to fade. Before you know it you hear a loud laughter,
