            The door creaks open. The tower smells of old paper.
            Maps cover every inch of the walls, obscured by frantic red marker lines.

        <p>
            A handwritten note is pinned to the center of the main map with a knife.

            You get confused, then you look down. A loose floorboard near the window has been pried up.
            Something silver glints in the darkness beneath it.

            It's heavy. As soon as you touch it, the static gets louder.
            The radio clicks on.

            You hold the locket up to the wall map, it a matching for the "Singing Tree" inscription to a red circle on the paper.

            When the silver touches the paper, the red marker lines seem to shift.
            You realize the pattern isn't random. The red circles form a <strong>Pentagon</strong> around the valley.

        <p>
            Tower 4 isn't a watchtower. It's a fence post. And the locket is a battery.
