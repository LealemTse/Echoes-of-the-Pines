    <div class="story-block">
        <p>
            You slide through the old fence flack of rusted iron brushing on your jacket. The air tastes metallic. You have stepped off the map and into Ashwood Valley.
        </p>

        <p>
            The trees here are unnaturally tall, their trunks twisting upward like they’re trying to escape something below. Their branches interlock so tightly that the daylight fades to a dim grey haze.
            Fog crawls along the forest floor, weaving between roots like it has a mind of its own
        </p>
        <p>
            Somewhere far ahead, you hear a faint clatter "metal on stone, or maybe bone on bark".
            No one comes out here anymore. No one wants to. You start looking around,
        </p>

        <label for="reveal-1" class="next-btn">Look around</label>
    </div>


    <input type="checkbox" id="reveal-1" class="story-toggle">

    <div class="hidden-content story-block" >
        <p>
            You scan the area. To your left, an old stump is covered in leaves, but there is glowing moss.
        </p>
        <div class="radio-msg">
            <p class="char-name">RADIO (104.5):</p>
            <span class="char-talk">
                    “...kzzt... I see a flashlight near the fence. Turn it off.”
            </span>

        <label for="reveal-2" class="next-btn">Grab the radio</label>

    <div class="hidden-content story-block">
        <p>
            You freeze. The radio wasn’t even on a moment ago.<br>

            You turn the dial in a panic, but the static stabilize on its own, snapping into perfect clarity.<br>
        </p>
        <div class="radio-msg">
            <p class="char-name">RADIO (104.5):</p>
            <span class="char-talk">
                    “You’re not supposed to be here,”
            </span>

        </div>
        <p>the voice says like someone repeating a warning they’ve given too many times.
            <br>
            A cold breeze rolls through the trees. Leaves rustle overhead, but not from the wind more like something moving through them.
            Your heart beats louder than the static.
        </p>
        <p>
            You press the radio to your ear.
            “Who are you?” you whisper.
            <br>
            A pause. Then a faint breath, as if the speaker is standing right behind you.
            <br>
        <div class="radio-msg">
            <p class="char-name">RADIO (104.5):</p>
            <span class="char-talk">
                    “...If you’re hearing this, they’ve already noticed you.”
            </span>

        </div>
            <br>
            The signal crackles violently and cuts off. The forest goes silent.
            <br>
            Then, somewhere behind you, a twig snaps.
        </p>
        <div class="radio-msg">

            </span>

        </div>
        <p>
           the voice says.
