            You kneel in the mud, your boots sinking slightly. Up close, the moss isn’t just glowing it’s <em>pulsing</em>,
            a slow, rhythmic beat, like it has a heartbeat of its own. It hasn’t grown randomly; someone or something
            has carefully cultivated it into a deliberate, unnerving shape.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your fingers tremble as you pull out your UV light. A beam cuts through the fog,
            striking the bark. The moss reacts immediately, illuminating patterns that weren’t visible before:
            intricate symbols, almost like a language carved in living green.
        </p>

        <p>A shiver runs down your spine. Whoever or whatever did this knew you would see it.
            It hasn't grown randomly. It has been cultivated into a shape.

            Under the UV beam, a symbol burns bright green against the dark wood. At first glance, it resembles a pine tree but inverted.
            Its roots claw toward the sky, while its branches dig deep into the earth, twisting unnaturally into the mud.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sight makes your stomach tighten. It’s as if the forest itself is watching, marking its territory—or issuing a warning.
        <br>
            Something about this place is alive… and it knows you’re here.
