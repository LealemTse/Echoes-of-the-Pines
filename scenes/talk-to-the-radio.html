            You lift the WakiTalki to your mouth. The static is thick, like trying to shout through a wet cloth.

            There is a long moment of only static. A low, wet cough, close enough that it feels like someone is standing right behind you.

            You look back down the path, but the fog has thickened behind you. You can't even see the path anymore.
