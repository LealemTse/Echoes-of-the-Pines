            You ignore the warning. You stay put, your fingers trembling as you twist the dial, trying to lock onto the friendly voice.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Come in”, you whisper. “Where should I go?”

            The static abruptly cuts out. Complete silence. The forest has gone dead quiet. No wind. No birds.

            Your blood runs cold. That’s <em>your</em> voice. Recorded from ten seconds ago.
            But it sounds... wrong. Wet. Hungry.

            You throw the radio into the mud, but the voice doesn't stop. It gets louder.
            It's not coming from the device anymore. It's coming from everywhere.
